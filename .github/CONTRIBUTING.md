## Code Of Conduct

The Xeon project's community should respect and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/radicalmind/xeon/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

## Before Submitting an Issue

Navigate through [issues](https://github.com/radicalmind/issues) and check if it has been already filled by other person.


Before post a new issue, please do an upgrade:

- Delete `$GOPATH/src/github.com/radicalmind`
- Open shell and execute the command: `go get -u github.com/radicalmind/xeon`
- Try to re-produce the issue

To be aware of the framework's changes and updates please **[star](https://github.com/radicalmind/xeon/stargazers)** and **[watch](https://github.com/radicalmind/xeon/watchers)** the repository.

Do not discuss things that they're not relative to the framework, keep Github issues useful for newcomers. A Github issue should exists to solve or report a problem. 

> If you want to talk about something else that can't be inside Github issues please [chat](https://gitter.im/xeon-go/Lobby) with us.

## Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request, do not file combo issues.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix. Therefore:

* Provide reproducable steps, what the result of the steps was, and what you would have expected.
* Description of what you expect to happen
* Animated GIFs
* Code that demonstrates the issue
* Version of Xeon
* Errors in the Terminal/Console
* When you have glide/godep installed, can you reproduce the issue when starting Xeon' station without these?
